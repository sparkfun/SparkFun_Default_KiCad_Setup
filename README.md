The SparkFun Default KiCad Setup is a complete KiCad project that contains a schematic and PCB. These are meant to be used as the starting point for a new KiCad project. Additionally, this project's settings can be imported into KiCad for things like layer stackup, DRC warnings, trace and via defaults, and other commonly used settings that need to be set, but usually only once.
